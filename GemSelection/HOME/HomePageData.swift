We can say that there is four type of gems find Color, Cut, Clarity and Crystal. Emerald (Be3Al2Si6O18) is the grass-green type of Beryl. The formation of emerald involves a natural process known as exometamorphism.\n\nTraditional gemstone for the astrological signs of Taurus, Cancer and sometimes Gemini. One of the quainter anecdotes on emeralds was by the 16th-century historian Brantôme, who referred to the many impressive emeralds the Spanish under Cortez had brought back to Europe from Latin America.\n\nNormally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emerald, crystal is considered a close second. Both are necessary conditions. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green hue as described below, but also a high degree of transparency to be considered a top gem.\n\nThe Swat emeralds show light red to red through the Chelsea color filter and completely absorb short-wave ultra-violet radiation.\n\nThis gives the rock its gemlike green color. Varying amount of iron also alters the color of the rock. It has a hardness of 7.5-8 and a refractive index of 1.57-1.59. However it is not a gem recommended for \'everyday\' use since it falls in the category of soft stone.\n\nA chemical analysis shows that chromium (which is the cause of the green of emerald) and iron are prominent constituents in Swat emeralds. The presence of relatively high iron content means that the emeralds from Swat do not show so red a fluresence as some other emeralds as iron acts as a fluresence quencher.\n\nThe cut of the stone is also significant. Emerald can have round, pear, oval shapes the emerald cut, that is, octagonal shape is most preferred. Inclusions are almost an accepted fact in emeralds.\n\nDeposits of the stone are also found in other parts of the world such as in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Nigeria.

Among the foremost consumers of emerald are USA and Japan who buy 75% of the world\'s cut emerald.\n\nColor is divided into three components: hue, saturation and tone. the hue must be bright.

Typical Brazilian emeralds are lighter and yellowish. Emeralds from Zimbabwe are smaller is size and lighter in shade. However the term \'African emerald\' is a misnomer. It simply denotes green fluorite.\nThis Gem of Lord Ganesha is the favoured Gem of the people seeking intellectual powers as well as for those seeking wealth .This calms down the nervous system and improves the capacity to take decisions.

The refractive index of the coating varies a little from sample. In Colombian stones, which constitute a high proportion of fine Emeralds used in Jewellery, the most constant features are flat cavities with upper and lower margins jagged like a coarse saw, containing liquid, a bubble of gas, and a little cube of rock salt.\n\nEmeralds from the Sandawana emerald mine in Zimbabwe have played quite an important role in the trade since their discovery in 1956. These are rich in chromium and thus a very deep and vivid green, which seen at its best in small stones.\n\nDark Green Emeralds have recently emanated from Pakistan, and these contain rather indeterminate inclusions, along which flakes of mika and small crystals of phenakite and dolomite could be recognized.\n\nSiberian Emeralds or more commonly known as Russian Emerald is a development of thin, cavities parallel to the basal plane. Silvery luster by reflected light, but in some directions may appear black, due to total reflections. In Transvaal emeralds mica is usually a major inclusion, while in Indian emeralds are found hexagonal cavities.\n\nEmeralds from the Ural mountains Siberian or Russian emeralds have quite a different occurrence, and this is reflected in their inclusion. Flakes of mica may be seen often broken, but the most distinctive features are blades of green actinolite cracks across. Siberian Emeralds is a development of thin, disc like cavities parallel to the basal plane. These show a silvery luster by reflected light, but in some directions may appear black, due total reflection.\n\nThe inclusions are mainly mica and liquid-filled cavities.

The possibility of the gemstone\'s having undergone some treatment or other is also a factor in determining the price,\n\nThe fact that this magnificent gemstone also comes in a large number of other colours was known for a long time almost only to insiders. In the trade, sapphires which are not blue are referred to as \'fancies\'.\n\nThe presence of small amounts of other elements, especially iron and chrome, are responsible for the colouring, turning a crystal that was basically white into a blue, red, yellow, pink or greenish sapphire. However, this does not mean that every corundum is also a sapphire.\n\nThus the blue of the sapphire has become a colour which fits in with everything that is constant and reliable. That is one of the reasons why women in many countries wish for a sapphire ring on their engagement. The sapphire symbolises loyalty, but at the same time it gives expression to people\'s love and longing."]

It also has the ruler ship over the Bone System on which the power of the body rests. The Red Cosmic Rays of Ruby affects the concentration of the mind and thus makes the mind goal oriented making it more prone to success. People who lack concentration or have lesser understanding benefit a lot from Ruby if they have the right type of Aura.\n\nAyurved, the ancient Indian scripture dealing with medicine, tells about a number of uses of Ruby Ash (Manik bhasma). It is said to prolong life and control the three vital elements Vays (air), Pitta (fire and Kapha (water). A number of diseases like Tuberculosis, Pains, Boils, Ulcers, Eye Troubles, Constipation, Effects of Poisons can be cured by it. The burning sensation in the stomach and the limbs can also be cured by it.\n\nHeart diseases, mental problems, problems of the bones, headaches, loss of glow in skin, loss of appetite and indigestion can also be cured by the Red Cosmic Rays of the Ruby.\n\nThe basic chakra or the mooldhara chakra contains a lot of Red energy in all living beings especially humans. The quantity of red colour determines the energy level of the person. If the basic chakra is depleted of the red energy due to any reason then the person has number of problems – like weakness, lack of heat in the body, circulation of blood is disturbed, the healing of injuries take a longer time to get alright and the body is unable to fight the attacks from bacteria and the person gets sick again and again.\n\nAll the major chakras, when seen Clairevoyantly, have some red colour in them. Thus, the wearing of Ruby which transfers a lot of red cosmic energy into our system helps strengthening all the major chakras of the body.Where bones are brittle or fractures are not healing this can be an effective remedy.\n\nAstrological Relevance of the Ruby Gemstone Ruby Gemstone is the Gem of Star Sun and is used to empower it. It is has some general benefits which include: \n\t1. It improves the real power of concentration. Better concentration of mind leads to all round achievements in personal and professional life.\n\t2. It improves the natural process of RBC building and helps in fighting anemia and other blood related deseases. It gives a glow on skin and face.\n\t3. It is the karka of Skeleton System and thus helps strengthening the Bones, Joints and the ligaments.\n\t4. It is the Gem of Sun, the most powerful body in our solar system, thus it helps achieve power, fame, glory and status.\n\t5. It gives emotional strength to the person to withstand deceit. It helps in strengthening the person\'s Bhagya i.e., Fate in people born with Leo i.e., Shimha Lagna, Aries i.e., Mesh Lagna, and Sagittarius i.e., Dhanu Lagna. It is also strongly recommended for people born in Libra i.e., Tula Lagna as the Sun God is the lord of the eleventh house - the house of all round gains. Let us understand the Effect of Ruby Gemstone on various Nakshatras:\n\n\n\t1. Ashwani: Gives bright eyes and sparkle.\n\t2. Bharni: Inproves initiative\n\t3. Kritika: Sharp features\n\t4. Rohini: Happy domestic life.\n\t5. Mraga: Diginity\n\t6. Ardra: Wealthy\n\t7. Punarvasu: Magnetic personality\n\t8. Pushya: Honorable and upright.\n\t9. Ashlesha: Wise and beautiful.\n\t10.

Before asking you to wear a blue sapphire or neelam the person recommending it to you will also ask you to test it. Let us discuss how neelam can be tested before actually wearing it.\n\nA neelam stone can be worn in ear rings, a finger ring or even as a pendant in a chain. We have already discussed how to recognize a genuine neelam and the points to watch out for while buying a neelam.\n\nWearing a blue sapphire protects against danger, travel problems, terror, thieves, accidents. \n\nIt can cause financial fortunes to change for the better, help with a person\'s career, and make the wearer rich. It can free one of mental anxiety.\n\nIt helps make one detached, and protects against envy. It can be worn for good luck and for protection against evil spirits.\n\nNeelam stone\'s are found in India, Burma, Ceylon, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Brazil and Africa. From the gemstone mines, the raw crystals are first taken to the cutting-centres where they are turned into sparkling gemstones by skilled hands.\n\nThe most valuable are genuine Kashmir stones. Burmese sapphires are valued almost as highly, and then come the sapphires from Ceylon. The possibility of the gemstone\'s having undergone some treatment or other is also a factor in determining the price,\n\nThe fact that this magnificent gemstone also comes in a large number of other colours was known for a long time almost only to insiders. In the trade, sapphires which are not blue are referred to as \'fancies\'.\n\nThe presence of small amounts of other elements, especially iron and chrome, are responsible for the colouring, turning a crystal that was basically white into a blue, red, yellow, pink or greenish sapphire. However, this does not mean that every corundum is also a sapphire.\n\nThus the blue of the sapphire has become a colour which fits in with everything that is constant and reliable. That is one of the reasons why women in many countries wish for a sapphire ring on their engagement. The sapphire symbolises loyalty, but at the same time it gives expression to people\'s love and longing."]
