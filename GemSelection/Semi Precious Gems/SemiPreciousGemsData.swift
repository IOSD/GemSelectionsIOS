Star rubies are very valuable. The finest star ruby known weighs 138 carats; this is the famous Rosier Reeves star ruby, on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The most striking phenomenon of rubies is the development of the six ray star, arranged in perfect symmetry, which shifts its centre, as the stone is moved. It is clearly visible under a single light source such as the sun or a lamp; much less so in diffuse light. If two or more powerful light sources are set close together, as many stars can be seen in the stone. Each light produces its own star, which is basically a reflection. The effect is usually less pronounced in more transparent stones. When the ground colour is ruby red it is known as Star Ruby. Benefits: Used to pep up the internal strength and to ward off tensions, Star Ruby drives away stress related problems like Migraine, Insomnia, and Hysteria etc. Traditionally worn by knights in the battlefields to protect themselves from the enemy. Local tales in Karnataka say that if this is worn as a visible pendant or as a head gear then anyone who faces you, as an enemy looses half his valour to your.
